# Common Gotchas
Try the following common errors to see what errors look like in React.  Find solutions for each.

- Forgetting to `return` JSX
- Confusing camelCase for HTML attributes `onclick vs onClick`
- Using `class` instead of `className`
- if using inline styles, using hyphenated names instead of camelCase 
  - ex: `background-color vs backgroundColor`
- Multiple top-level elements without a wrapper/fragment
- DON'T use if statements directly inside JSX like `return ( if (isLoggedIn) { <p>Welcome</p> });`
- Not using `key` in lists
- JSX requires properly closed tags, even for void elements. ex: `<input /> <br />`
- what happens if props are undefined? ex: `return (<div className={someUndefinedClass}>Hi</div>)`
- if `numOfItems` is 0, this will render 0 `{numOfItems && <ShoppingList items={shoppingList} />}`
- examine if there are any more red squiggly lines in VSCode?

# Exercise: Lifting State Up
Parent-Child communication means having a parent component manage the state, and pass down state setters as props

- see https://unit06-lesson02.netlify.app/4
- Identify where state needs to located, and where state needs to be lifted up

# Optional: Configure imports to use absolute path

- Use ChatGPT to help you configure your tsconfig.json, tsconfig.app.json, vite.config.ts
- ‚ùå BEFORE: Using relative paths can be a pain point, especially when refactoring locations of files/folders
- ‚úÖ AFTER: should now be able to use `import Component from '@/components/whatever'
